<p>Vespucci is a cross-platform software tool for spectroscopic imaging and analysis. Vespucci is free software distributed under the terms of the GNU General Public License. Vespucci is written in C++ using the Qt library for GUI widgets, the QCustomPlot library for image creation, the Armadillo library for matrix mathematics and the MLPACK library for machine learning. Vespucci is capable of several analysis methods, including univariate mapping (with intensities, bandwidths, peak area, and band ratio determination methods), principal components analysis, vertex components analysis with endmember extraction, partial-least-squares determinant analysis and k-means clustering. In addition to multivariate analysis and image creation, Vespucci can perform several data pre-processing operations, including filtering, de-noising, Savitzky-Golay smoothing, normalization, background subtraction, and baseline correction. </p>

<p>Vespucci is designed with several main goals in mind: (1) Mathematical transparency: All operations are logged, allowing the user to remember which operations were performed. In comparison with well-established mathematical analysis programs such as MATLAB, which produce similar results, this fully-documented code is open-source (distributed under the GNU General Public License). (2) Ease-of-use: Users can perform all actions entirely through a simple GUI, without remembering function calls. No outside software package is required. Users of this software only have to be scientists, not computer programmers. It is hoped that this ease-of-use will allow for wider adoption of multivariate analysis techniques in spectroscopic imaging. (3) Extensibility: Users having only a beginner’s familiarity with C++ can write new methods and contribute to the project easily. This is achieved by the use of libraries that utilize syntax deliberately similar to the common scientific programming languages MATLAB and Octave. The project is compiled with commonly-available programming tools, and binaries of the relevant libraries are available for potential contributors. (4) Versatility: Vespucci can theoretically handle any dataset that consists of evenly-spaced spatial data with a corresponding digital signal, including molecular spectroscopic images, mass spectrometric images and X-ray diffraction data. </p>

<p>Currently, Vespucci can only handle ASCII files in either a "wide" format (where each line is a spectra) or "long" format, where each line is a point on the spectra. Vespucci can export images in JPEG, PNG and TIFF formats and data in CSV and tab-delimited ASCII formats.</p>
