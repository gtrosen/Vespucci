Vespucci is free software distributed under the terms of the GNU General Public License. Vespucci is written in C++ using the Qt library for GUI widgets, the QCustomPlot library for image creation, the Armadillo library for matrix mathematics and the MLPACK library for machine learning. Vespucci is capable of several analysis methods, including univariate mapping (with intensities, bandwidths, peak area, and band ratio determination methods), principal components analysis, vertex components analysis with endmember extraction, partial-least-squares determinant analysis and k-means clustering. In addition to multivariate analysis and image creation, Vespucci can perform several data pre-processing operations, including filtering, de-noising, Savitzky-Golay smoothing, normalization, background subtraction, and baseline correction. \r\n\r\nVespucci is designed with several main goals in mind:\r\n+ *Mathematical transparency*. All operations are logged and reference internal function names. The code is entirely opensource so users may examine the internals of the program\r\n+ *Ease of use*. The Vespucci UI is designed to be as easy to use as possible to remove barriers between researchers and results.\r\n+ *Extensibility*. Vespucci uses the Armadillo and MLPACK libraries, which have very intuitive APIs for novice C++ programmers familiar with MATLAB or Octave. This makes modification of the software and contribution to its development fairly easy.\r\n+ *Versatility*. Vespucci can theoretically handle any dataset consisting of spatial data combined with a corresponding digital signal.\r\n\r\nÂ© 2014 Wright State University\r\nDaniel P.
